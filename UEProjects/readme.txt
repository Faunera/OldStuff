Folder: VRUE

School project for VR made in Unreal Engine 5. Device we used for VR was Oculus Rift.
Goal of the project was to make a serious game, so our goal was to make a game in which player would do various fitness moves to complete different spells.
This project was my first time making anything in Unreal Engine and for VR that matter.

I learned a lot about how it is like to use UE and how different it is to make games for VR.

Folder: UE_FPS

Another school project on Unreal Engine 5.
Goal of this project was to make a metroidvania-like FPS game.
Throughout this project I refined my skills with UE, and learned a lot more about game development than I had from my previous projects.
While we managed to stay in schedule, I believe there was too little vision and discussion for the game as a whole.
If we had more time for the project and discussed it, I think we could've managed to make a story for the game in which the player could be at least little invested in and more intricate level design fitting a metroidvania game.
Currently the game is a fps game with no real story ingame in which the player can find powerups that give new abilities and allow access to certain powerups in previous levels they couldn't access before.

The most important thing I learned was, how important communication is for game development.
